# bit-count
For explanations see [CodeAbbey Task #81](https://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/bit-count)

## Requirements:
- [ ] draw the activity diagram / write pseudocode
- [ ] upload the code you used to solve the problem

### Extra
What if I say that you have a string?
Counting odd bits for each and every character is boring. Let's count vowels ('aeiouy') instead.
There is a [task](https://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/vowel-count) on CodeAbbey for this

## Tips
- try rewriting it in another programming language
